# Implementing-Simple-Linear-Regression-from-Scratch

Objective
The purpose of this is to deepen your understanding of simple linear regression by implementing it without relying on any libraries like Scikit-learn. You will learn how to calculate the best-fit line parameters and make predictions using basic Python and NumPy.

Problem Statement
You are given a dataset containing two variables, X (independent variable) and y (dependent variable). Your task is to:

Implement functions to calculate the slope (m) and intercept (b) of the line  y=mx+b .
Use these parameters to make predictions for new data points.
Calculate the Mean Squared Error (MSE) to evaluate your model.
