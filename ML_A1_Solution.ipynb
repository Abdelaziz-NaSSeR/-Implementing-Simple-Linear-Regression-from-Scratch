You will learn how to calculate the best-fit line parameters and make predictions using basic Python and NumPy.\n","\n","---\n","\n","## **Instructions**\n","1. Read the problem statement and comments in the code carefully.\n","2. Complete each section marked as **TODO**.\n","3. Use NumPy for mathematical operations.\n","4. Ensure your implementation is modular, with clear and reusable functions.\n","5. Test your code to ensure it runs as expected.\n","\n","---\n","\n","## **Problem Statement**\n","You are given a dataset containing two variables, `X` (independent variable) and `y` (dependent variable). Your task is to:\n","1. Implement functions to calculate the slope (`m`) and intercept (`b`) of the line $y = mx + b$.\n","2. Use these parameters to make predictions for new data points.\n","3. Calculate the Mean Squared Error (MSE) to evaluate your model.\n"],"id":"5R_bPqGcqkne"},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":13,"metadata":{"id":"CEok_Qeqqknh","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1733502814487,"user_tz":-120,"elapsed":1677,"user":{"displayName":"Abdelaziz NaSSeR","userId":"13881073537674809821"}}},"outputs":[],"source":["# Import necessary libraries\n","import numpy as np"],"id":"CEok_Qeqqknh"},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"Z6rj8XVzqknj"},"source":["### **Step 1: Calculate the mean values of X and y**"],"id":"Z6rj8XVzqknj"},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":14,"metadata":{"id":"QdVwDuS1qknk","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1733502814487,"user_tz":-120,"elapsed":41,"user":{"displayName":"Abdelaziz NaSSeR","userId":"13881073537674809821"}}},"outputs":[],"source":["def calculate_means(X, y):\n","    \"\"\"\n","    Calculate the means of X and y.\n","    \"\"\"\n","    # TODO: Implement the calculation of mean\n","    X_mean = np.mean(X)\n","    y_mean = np.mean(y)\n","    return X_mean, y_mean"],"id":"QdVwDuS1qknk"},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"KWKpXbxjqknl"},"source":["### **Step 2: Calculate the slope (m) and intercept (b)**"],"id":"KWKpXbxjqknl"},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":15,"metadata":{"id":"tCyMUbKRqknl","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1733502814488,"user_tz":-120,"elapsed":41,"user":{"displayName":"Abdelaziz NaSSeR","userId":"13881073537674809821"}}},"outputs":[],"source":["def calculate_slope_and_intercept(X, y):\n","    \"\"\"\n","    Calculate the slope and intercept for the best-fit line.\n","    \"\"\"\n","    X_mean, y_mean = calculate_means(X, y)\n","\n","    # TODO: Implement the formula for slope (m)\n","    numerator = np.sum((X-X_mean) * (y-y_mean))\n","    denominator = np.sum((X-X_mean) ** 2)\n","    m = numerator / denominator\n","\n","    # TODO: Calculate intercept (b)\n","    b = y_mean -
